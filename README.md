# LightWire

 - Lightwire is a simple banking app project that focuses on the fundamentals that I've learned during the Springboard Fullstack Software Engineering Bootcamp: a secure, well-authenticated and well-architected API; a clean and coherent user interface and design; and an ease of use that makes it simple to accomplish everyday banking needs like setting up an account, transferring money, creating and viewing bank-statements and more.

 - Frontend and backend built out with JavaScript (React.Js, Express.Js, Node). PostgreSQL for database management, etc.
